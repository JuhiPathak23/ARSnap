# ARSNAP - Augmented Reality Snapshots 🌟
ARSNAP is a web application that allows real-time application of augmented reality (AR) filters to webcam captures. Designed as my initial exploration into VR and AR technologies, this project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in creating interactive AR experiences directly within web browsers.

## Purpose and Objectives 🎯
The primary goal of ARSNAP is to demonstrate the integration of AR capabilities using web technologies. By offering a selection of AR filters such as hats, glasses, and earrings, users can engage with augmented reality in a fun and interactive way. This project serves as a foundation for further experimentation and learning in the realms of virtual and augmented realities.
